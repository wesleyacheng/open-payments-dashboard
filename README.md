Better dashboard for Open Payments API

## Context
Open Payments (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov) is a government program that publishes financial data about relatioship between pharma and doctors.
The hope is that this will provide a more transparent system to limit the perverse incentive of doctors prescribing medications made by those pharma companies who pay them.

## Motivation
I was curious to know who was the most paid in a given year, but I had to do manual analysis of the data using pandas myself which is out of reach for most people.
So I intend to simplify the process so that people can be informed about their doctors and relationship with pharma in general.

## Plan
Make a better dashboard using the "dash" library (https://pypi.org/project/dash/)

## Technologies
[dash](https://plotly.com/dash/),
