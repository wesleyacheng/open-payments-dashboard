Better dashboard for Open Payments API (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov)

Context:
Open Payments is a government program that publishes financial data about relatioship between pharma and doctors.
The hope is that this will provide a more transparent system to limit the perverse incentive of doctors prescribing medications made by those pharma who pay them to.

Motivation:
I was curious to know who was the most paid in a given year, but I had to do manual analysis of the data using pandas myself which is out of reach for most people.
So I intend to simplify the process so that people can be informed about their doctors and relationship with pharma in general.

## Plan
Make a better dashboard using the "dash" library (https://pypi.org/project/dash/)
